# Advantek Shuffleboard
My first Web Application was made with ASP.NET Core using Entity Framework. This was made in a two-week span in which I was in work placement for Advantek. My task was to create a simple Web Application using any framework and code language as long as I learned something new. This Web App was going to be used to track shuffleboard scores for their shuffleboard game.

This Web App has not been modified since it was created other than adding comments for self-understanding. There is some stupid and redundant logic. However, as this was my first Web Application, I will not fix or improve anything.
